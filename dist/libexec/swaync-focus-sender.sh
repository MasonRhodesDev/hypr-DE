# swaync-focus-sender
#
# Generic notification-click focus proxy for Hyprland.
#
# Invoked by swaync via scripts.run-on = "action" — i.e. whenever the user
# clicks a notification body (which also fires the XDG default action back to
# the originating app, so the app still routes to the right conversation /
# thread / issue / etc).
#
# Apps on Wayland can't reliably raise their own windows — Electron only
# forwards the notification activation token from Electron 42 on
# (electron/electron#50568), and older apps park on Hyprland special
# workspaces (scratchpads) they can't summon. So we piggyback: map the
# notification's sender identity to a Hyprland client and bring it to focus.
#
# Per-app recovery plugins live in ~/.config/hypr-de/notify-plugins/<name>.sh (name = lowercased
# desktop-entry or app-name, full and last-dot-segment are tried, so both
# "slack" and flatpak ids like com.discordapp.Discord → "discord" resolve).
# A plugin's `on_action` runs in the background with the notification's
# stored context (see store-context.sh) and can e.g. re-issue the navigation
# as a deep link when the sender has already forgotten the notification.
#
# swaync sets these env vars for scripts:
#   SWAYNC_APP_NAME       — "Slack", "discord", "Thunderbird", ...
#   SWAYNC_DESKTOP_ENTRY  — the .desktop basename, when the sender sets the
#                           "desktop-entry" hint (more reliable than app name)
#   SWAYNC_ID, SWAYNC_TIME (epoch s), SWAYNC_SUMMARY, SWAYNC_BODY, ...
