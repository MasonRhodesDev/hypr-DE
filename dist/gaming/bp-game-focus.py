"""Steam Big Picture / game session state machine for Hyprland.

States (derived from the active window):
  DESKTOP - normal desktop use. Game windows opening here load in the
            background (rules.conf blocks their initial focus).
  BP      - Big Picture is the active window. Kept fullscreen at all times.
  GAME    - a game window is active. Game windows opening here steal focus
            and are fullscreened (covers splash -> main window chains).

Inputs:
  - Hyprland socket2 events: openwindow / closewindow / activewindowv2 /
    fullscreen
  - Gamepad guide button (BTN_MODE) via evdev, with bluetooth hotplug:
      press -> focus newest game window; else focus Big Picture; else launch
      Big Picture (never the desktop Steam window — it lives on special:magic)
  - SIGUSR1 simulates a guide press (for testing / keyboard binds)
  - Steam CEF log (cef_log.txt) tail: detects GPU-process crashes and, on a
    crash storm with no game running, cleanly restarts Steam (recovery)

rules.conf keeps no_initial_focus/focus_on_activate off on game windows and
focus_on_activate off on Big Picture; this daemon is the only thing moving
focus between them, and it touches the BP window as little as possible —
rapid reparent/resize churn on XWayland is what triggers the CEF GPU
context-loss crash that drops Big Picture to software rendering (the lag).

On startup it also re-applies the --disable-gpu-process-crash-limit flag to
Steam's webhelper wrapper (Steam overwrites it on client updates) so a single
GPU context-loss crash respawns the GPU process instead of permanently
falling back to software.
